ZFS Backups Proper
    - Integrate snapshotting into backup procedure
    - Never use recursive replication, replicate one snap at a time incrementals for each dataset
    - Problem can exist during initial sync
        - Move to always doing a full sync via disk hand-offs if it will take longer than a day.
    - Queue up snapshot deletions, only run them in between snapshot replications
        - Always create snapshots however
    - Run as a daemon, caching data as needed to help ;)
